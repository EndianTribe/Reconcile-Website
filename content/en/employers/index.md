## For Software Engineers and Teams

You can find my app available for [internal testing on Google Play Store here](https://play.google.com/apps/internaltest/4701718537664687824).

*If you would like to try the app out, please get in touch through the recruiter so I can add you to the list to enable access.*

To get an idea of my app's functionality and user interface, check out [how to use](https://reconcile.endiantribe.com/docs/overview/how-to-use/).

To get an idea of the app's architecture, check out my [soliloquy on the app's technical details](https://reconcile.endiantribe.com/docs/under_the_hood/technical-details/).

While the git commit history is not public, you can get a sense of the app's progression since internal testing by checking out the [release notes](https://reconcile.endiantribe.com/docs/under_the_hood/release-notes/) and/or the [issue tracker](https://github.com/EndianTribe/Reconcile-Issues-Tracker-Public/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
