## My Background

### Financial Services

I started my career as a hedge fund analyst in Manhattan. Unlike most other new hires in the firm, I was not your typical "finance bro" type and mostly avoided lavish company parties if at all possible. At work I found solace in nerdy stuff: from writing simple data ingestion scripts to orchestrating a local-to-cloud services migration. By the time I left the company I made Principal (directly below Managing Director) and was in charge of the firm's software and infrastructure needs.

### Georgia Tech

After my departure from the hedge fund I completed Georgia Tech's master program in Computer Science. I wanted to indulge in my computer interests and needed the diploma validation for future employers. I chose the [Computing Systems specialization](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-computing-systems) and achieved a 3.9 GPA. I would not hesitate to say that the [vast majority of the skills I gained from Georgia Tech are likely not conducive to being a productive employee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_Against_Education#Signaling_model). I nevertheless enjoyed my tutelage tremendously. The classes I enjoyed the most happened to be the most challenging for me: specifically writing a multithreading program in C in [Intro to OS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6200-introduction-operating-systems) and learning processor components in [High Performance Computer Architecture](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6290-high-performance-computer-architecture).

### Hobbies

**The Outdoors**: While I am no Bear Grylls, I very much enjoy nature. Physical exertion is just a price I have to pay to gaze upon breathtaking vistas. My partner and I moved to Vegas in no small part because of this: the city is within driving distance to 7 [national parks](https://www.nps.gov/findapark/index.htm)!

**Video Games**: I grew up playing [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/) but stopped at Legion when Blizzard began suffocating the franchise. Now I play [Overwatch 2](https://overwatch.blizzard.com) casually with friends and secretly sneak in a game of [Bloons TD 6](https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Mobile/Bloons-TD-6.html) when nobody is watching. There was a time when I was very much into mentally-taxing management games such as the [Anno series](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/anno/1800), [Civilization](https://civilization.com), and [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com). But now they are effectively replaced by my personal project and LeetCode.

**Systems Stuff**: I enjoy having a needlessly complicated home lab environment. I use [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org) for routing, [Ubiquiti](https://ui.com/switching) for switching, [Unraid](https://unraid.net) for data storage, [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com) for home services (e.g., [Plex](https://www.plex.tv)). I have also automated the house with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) controlling a wide variety of devices including [Lutron RA2](https://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/WholeHomeSystems/RadioRA2/Overview.aspx), [Shelley Automation](https://shelly.cloud), and numerous [Z-Wave](https://www.z-wave.com) and [Zigbee](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/zigbee/) products.
