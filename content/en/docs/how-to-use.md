## Log a Journal Entry

* When a shared expense takes place, fire up the app, which will display your ledger, which is currently empty.
* Tap the plus button to add a new journal entry.
* Make sure you have the correct counterparty, who is the person with whom you share the expense.
* The amount should be equal to the counterparty's responsibility.
* If this amount is what the counterparty owes you, then tap "Debit." If this amount is what you owe the counterparty, then tap "Credit."
* Voila! You will have your first journal entry on your ledger.

## Check Balance

* Tap the search button at the top right corner of the screen.
* Select the counterparty you wish to check your balance on.
* Tap "Search." Your outstanding balance against the selected counterparty is at the top of the ledger. Remember, a positive number is a debit, which means the counterparty owes you. A negative number is a credit, which means you owe the counterparty.
