## Secure and Easy Google Sign-In

You don't have to sign up manually and keep a different set of passwords for Reconcile.

## Offline Support

You can continue to view the ledger and add new journal entries even when you are offline.

## Realtime Updates

When you are online, any changes you make will be instantly reflected in the cloud. Even if you lose your phone, you will never lose your Reconcile ledger.

## System Dark/Light Theme

The app respects your system-wide dark/light theme. No more oculi-searing bright light!

## Dummy Data Test Mode

Try out the app when you first install it without any actual journal entries by enabling test mode.

## Tap Top Bar to Return to Top

Regardless of your scroll position, you can always tap the title bar text to return to top.

## Sticky Header Stats

Header stats are sticky for your viewing convenience.

## Non-Blocking Smooth UI

Heavy backend operations are relegated to a different thread, thereby enabling a smooth UI experience.

## Clean Focus and Keyboard Interaction

Android system keyboard conforms to different needs of input fields. For instance, the system would only provide a number pad for value input field. The "next" button seamlessly transitions the focus to the next appropriate input field.

## Input Validation

Input is validated before being submitted to the cloud. No more invalid data entries that mess up the ledger.

## Enforced Integrity

Accounting integrity is enforced in Reconcile, which you can learn more [here](https://reconcile.endiantribe.com/docs/overview/rules-of-accounting/).
