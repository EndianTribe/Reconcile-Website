## Roommates

You are on the lease and responsible for payments related to rent, utilities, shared meals, and so forth. Your roommate pays you in installments throughout the month. You need a way to track the balance.

## Partners

You and your partner maintain separate finances and want to keep track of shared expenses (housing, utilities, transport, food, and so forth) and has an effectively perpetual open tab.

## Friends

You are planning an epic trip (or maybe just a shared meal) with your friends and need a way to track costs and repayments.
