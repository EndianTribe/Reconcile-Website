When a shared expense takes place, fire up the app, which will display your ledger, which is currently empty. Tap the plus button to add a new journal entry. Make sure you have the correct counterparty, who is the person with whom you share the expense. The amount should be equal to the counterparty&amp;rsquo;s responsibility. If this amount is what the counterparty owes you, then tap &amp;ldquo;Debit.</description></item><item><title>Rules of Accounting</title><link>https://reconcile.endiantribe.com/docs/overview/rules-of-accounting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reconcile.endiantribe.com/docs/overview/rules-of-accounting/</guid><description>Entry Immutability #
Once a journal entry is entered onto the ledger, it cannot be changed.
If you discovered a mistake on an existing journal entry, enter another journal entry with the opposite value to cancel it out. You can even add notes to the journal entry to remind yourself (and the other party) the reason.
No Backdating #
A journal entry&amp;rsquo;s date is timestamped by the server and cannot be modified.</description></item></channel></rss>
