CI/CD #
Not having to manually deploy to Google Play Store for every new release would be nice.
Code Style Enforcement #
At the moment linting is optional. One day I plan to clean up my code and enforce lint rules. One day.
Error Handling #
At the moment I am certain there are uncaught exceptions. I intend to catch them all.
Replace Static Fields with String Resources #
I plan to replace static string fields with @StringRes for better testability.</description></item><item><title>Internal Testing</title><link>https://reconcile.endiantribe.com/docs/under_the_hood/internal-testing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://reconcile.endiantribe.com/docs/under_the_hood/internal-testing/</guid><description>Thank you for participating in the exclusive internal test program of Reconcile the Android app. This page will explain to you the appâ€™s purpose, its current implementation, and your role in the test process.
